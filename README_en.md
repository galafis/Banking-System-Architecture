## Overview

This repository presents a modular and scalable banking system architecture, designed to demonstrate best practices in software development for the financial sector. The goal is to provide a robust foundation for building modern banking applications, focusing on security, performance, maintainability, and regulatory compliance. The proposed architecture aims to facilitate the integration of new services and adaptation to future market demands.

## Key Features

The hypothetical banking system supports the following essential functionalities:

*   **Account Management:** Opening, closing, balance inquiry, detailed statements, and management of different account types (checking, savings, investment).
*   **Financial Transactions:** Deposits, withdrawals, interbank and intrabank transfers, bill payments, and scheduled transactions.
*   **Robust Security:** Implementation of multi-factor authentication (MFA), role-based access control (RBAC), encryption of data in transit and at rest, and continuous monitoring for suspicious activities.
*   **RESTful APIs:** Well-defined interface for integration with external systems, partners, and mobile applications, utilizing security standards such as OAuth2.
*   **Reporting and Analytics:** Generation of financial reports, monitoring dashboards, and analytical tools to support decision-making.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following folders, reflecting a microservices or well-defined module approach:

*   `src/`: Contains the main source code for backend services, organized by domain (e.g., `src/accounts`, `src/transactions`).
*   `tests/`: Includes unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure code quality and robustness.
*   `docs/`: Stores all project documentation, including technical specifications, API guides, architecture diagrams and user manuals.
*   `config/`: Configuration files for different environments (development, staging, production).
*   `frontend/`: Contains the user interface, developed with modern web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, frameworks like React or Angular).
*   `database/`: Database migration scripts, schemas, and sample data.

## Technologies Used

This architecture employs a combination of modern technologies to ensure scalability, resilience, and ease of development:

*   **Backend:** Python (Flask/Django) or Java (Spring Boot) for microservices.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL for transactional data and MongoDB for unstructured data or logs.
*   **Messaging:** Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication between services.
*   **Cache:** Redis for data caching and sessions.
*   **Frontend:** React.js or Vue.js for a dynamic user experience.
*   **Containerization:** Docker for packaging and isolating services.
*   **Orchestration:** Kubernetes for managing and scaling containers.
*   **Cloud:** Deployment on platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed in your environment:

*   Python 3.x
*   pip (Python package manager)
*   Docker and Docker Compose (optional, for containerized execution)
*   Node.js and npm/yarn (for the frontend)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/galafis/Banking-System-Architecture.git
    cd Banking-System-Architecture
    ```
2.  Install backend dependencies (if a `requirements.txt` exists):
    ```bash
    pip install -r config/requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Install frontend dependencies (if a `package.json` exists):
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install # or yarn install
    cd ..
    ```

### Execution

To start the system (simple backend service example):

```bash
python src/main.py
```

To start the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start # or yarn start
cd ..
```

To run with Docker Compose (if configured):

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
